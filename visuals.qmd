The current section provides **graphical representations** of the algorithms and models I have developed using raw Tracking data.
Due to the intellectual property policies of the company I work for, it is not possible for me to publicly share the source code of the following works.

These data are received both **in real time with minimal latency** directly from the provider (*Hawkeye*) via Rabbit queue consumption and **Post-Match** (in their scrubbed version) to ensure greater data accuracy and cleanliness. \

*Other provider tested: OptaVision, tracking capture from Broadcast signal (OpenCV, Yolo)*

### From **Tracking Camera** to 2D 

The flow of ball and joints raw data in **3D**, approximated in **2D**, for a fast and clean graphical representation of the match (here a portion)â€” *a dream come true for Football Manager enthusiasts like me!*

### From 2D to **individual focus** 

The individual focus highlighted *below* as starting point for the spatiotemporal analysis: an entire algorithmic framework is developed for **physical/athletic** and movement KPIs (*distance covered, sprints, accelerations, MPE, ...*) for each of the involved entities.

&nbsp;

### From individual focus to **shapes** 

Spatially monitoring the team throughout the match to identify **geometric** characteristics (*length, width, centroid, distance between players, ...*) in both phases (possession and non-possession).

&nbsp;

### From shape to **discrete space** to control  

Starting to divide the **space** into occupied zones and zones of responsibility for an initial approximation of **territorial dominance**.

&nbsp;

### From discrete to **continuous** 

Constructing **Pitch Control** model with more realistic conflict zones modeled by a *continuous probability surface*.

### From points to **networks** 

From isolated points to a **dynamic network** as a tool for *Complex System analysis*, focusing on **distances** and **passing lines**.

### From formations to **dynamic modules** (*in possession*) 

*Dynamic evaluation of the team's formation* in **possession** during the match, compared to a static formation defined as the starting reference at kickoff.

### From formations to **dynamic modules** (*out of possession*) 

*Dynamic evaluation of the formation* **out of possession** as a tool for capturing **defensive patterns and movements**.

### From movements to **dangerous** choices  

Development of a predictive and decision-making model to identify risky/dangerous **choices** and/or evaluate the contribution of **off-ball movements**.

### From movements to **scanning**  

An R&D project aimed at calculating the **ball carrier's field of view** from raw 3D data. The model can be extended to construct the field of view for any player involved.

### From movements to **motion interactions**  

**2D modeling of on-field movement** as a *Bivariate Gaussian* and **conflict surface** in the case of **pressure**. On the left graph, an example of the central forward, and on the right, the dynamic result surface depending on distance with respect to nearest opponents. The main objective of the algorithm is to identify the availability zones (short, long, ...) near the reference player.
