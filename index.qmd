Hello, this is Simone.

I am a Developer and Football Data Scientist based in Bologna (Italy). 

Methodic and thoughtful: *problem posing and problem solving are my guidelines*. \
I firmly believe in the power of numbers and data to draw a reliable map for any creation process (*as the ball conduction below*).
